Exercise 1
================

## Question 1

Study: Adding 8” plates along with 12” plates in Google’s cafeteria.

What Google found: stocking cafeterias with 8-inch plates alongside 12-
inch plates encouraged people to eat smaller, healthier portions.

1.  Possible design of the study

NR: the employees already knew the experience of eating in the
cafeteria, not a true random experiment

O1: only offer the 8-inch plates in the cafeteria and observe the
employees’ eating habit

O2: only offer the 12-inch plates in the cafeteria and observe the
employees’ eating habit

X: put 8-inch plates alongside 12-inch plates

O3: observe the eating habit when offered these two plates size

2.  Threats and possible way to address

The O1 and O2 phases may have an impact on the employees’ decision on O3
phase. It is possible that they will make some decision intentionally on
O3 phase

Maybe we can select different people to do O1 and O2 phase, instead of
letting the same group of people go through both of the stages. even
though using different group of people will affect the results, Google
has a big employee base, the average should be able to tell something.

Another threat is that the two groups’ decision on O3 phase maybe
affected by exposing to 8-inch plate first or 12-inch plate first. It is
hard to define the legitimacy of the experiment results.

## Question 2

Which tactic helps employee performance?

My understanding of the data sheet

1.  Column A: the performance rate without any motivation
2.  Column B: the performance rate under the motivation A
3.  Column C: the performance rate under the motivation B

Why the data shows tactic B is more effective while the expert says that
the tactic A is helping the performance?

Possible reasons

1.  The performance improvement/decline is not directly affected by the
    usage of the tactics. Maybe there are some other attributes. For
    example, the day before using tactic B, the employee was performing
    a hard task, while the day the person was motivated by tactic B,
    she/he was having a easy task. Therefore, the performance was not
    affected by the tactic, but the tasks.

2.  After experiencing the tactic A, the employees may intentionally
    perform better when they were giving tactic B because they already
    knew the context, and also they could compare tactic B with tactic
    A.
